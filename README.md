Beware this can spam keyboard input at whatever window is focused if something blocks the game window.     
Especially when a round ends, or changing resolution. Alt+n will close all of the windows, but only if they are not currently busy (they are busy when playing game).

To use:
Run all the scripts. This will spawn 4 console windows.    
Use the keybinds alt+a, alt+b, alt+c, alt+d to select the left, up, down and right game arrows respectively.     
With your mouse cursor over the position of the arrows on your screen.     
Ensure the game window is focused.      
Works for any version, browser/downloaded.
